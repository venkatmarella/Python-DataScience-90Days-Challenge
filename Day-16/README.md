# Python-DataScience-90Days-Challenge - Day16

Day 16 of the Python Data Science 90 Days Challenge is all about OOPS. Object Oriented Programming in Python. Today we will be learning how to create a class.

#### Python Inheritance:
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows us to create new classes based on existing ones.

Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.

Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

Inheritance allows us to create a new class based on an existing one by adding new methods or attributes and/or modifying those of the parent class. It simplifies code reuse and makes it.

In Python, a child class can inherit attributes and methods from its parent class using the `inherits` keyword followed by the name of the parent class. 

super()  function in Python returns a temporary object of the parent class and allows us to access its attributes and methods.
