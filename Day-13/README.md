# Python-DataScience-90Days-Challenge - Day13

Day 12 of the Python Data Science 90 Days Challenge is all about For loops.  We will be learning how to use for loop in python and also understanding its syntax.

While loop in python  is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as the condition remains True.

#For loop - limit for itterations/ range/ set of values...

#while loop - untill somthing is satisfied or triggered

#### While loop Syntax: 
```
while condition:
    # body of while loop
```
#### Example: Table 
```
number = 1
while number <= 3:
    print(number)
    number = number + 1
```
