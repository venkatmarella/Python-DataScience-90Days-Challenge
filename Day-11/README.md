# Python-DataScience-90Days-Challenge - Day11

Day 11 of the Python Data Science 90 Days Challenge is all about Conditional Statements. We will be learning how to use if and elif statements in Python along with the else.

## if statement in python:
python has a special type of control flow called conditional execution, which is achieved using the if statement.

python has a special type of control flow called conditional statements , which is used to execute certain blocks of code based on the evaluation of conditions. 

python has a special type of control flow called if statements. An if statement is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition evaluates to True. The syntax for an if statement is as follows
```
if syntax:
if condition: 
    code block to execute if the condition is True
else:
    code block to execute if the condition is False
```
### Example Code:

x = 5
y = 3

if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
elif x == y:
    print("x is equal to y")
else:
    print("x is less than y")

#### Output: x is greater than y
Note: indentation  of the code blocks are important. If you don't provide correct indentation, it will give an error.
