# Python-DataScience-90Days-Challenge - Day20

Day 20 of the Python Data Science 90 Days Challenge is all about encapsulation and data abstration.

Encapsulation:

Encapsulation is a concept of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit called a class. 
It helps in hiding the implementation details and allows access to the data only through defined methods.

Private:
Private attributes or methods can only be accessed within the class and are not visible outside the class.

Public:
Public attributes or methods can be accessed from anywhere.

Protected:
Protected attributes or methods can be accessed within the class and its subclasses.

Data Abstraction:
Data abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the relevant information to the outside world. 
In Python, abstraction can be achieved using abstract classes and abstract methods.
