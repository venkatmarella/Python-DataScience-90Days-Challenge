# Python-DataScience-90Days-Challenge - Day17

Day 17 of the Python Data Science 90 Days Challenge is all about OOPS. Object Oriented Programming in Python. Today we will be learning how to create a Polymorphism.

#### Python Polymorphism:
Polymorphism in python  is a way to create classes that can be used as base class for other classes. It allows us Method Overloading and Overriding in Python.

Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass has the same name and signature as the method in the superclass, but it provides a different behavior.

Method overloading refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in a class. However, Python does not support method overloading directly like some other programming languages. Instead, it can be simulated using default arguments or variable-length arguments.
