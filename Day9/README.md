# Python-DataScience-90Days-Challenge - Day9

## Sets
A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It supports operations like union, intersection and difference. In this day we will learn about sets in python and how to use them effectively.  performed using curly brackets `{}` 

### Set Operations 
Access
Add
Remove
Join

### Set Methods 
add()	        Add an element to the set.
clear() 	    Remove all elements from the set.
copy()	    	Return a copy of the set.
difference()    Return a set that is the difference between two sets. (set1 - set2)
difference_update()    Update a set with the difference of two other sets. (set1 -= set2)
discard(x)  	Remove x from the set if it exists.
intersection()   Return a set that contains common elements with another set. (set1 & set2)
isdisjoint()      Check if two or more sets have no common elements.
issubset()       Check if a set is a subset of another set.
issuperset()     Check if a set is a superset of another set.
join()           Join two sets.
pop()            Remove and return an arbitrary element from the set. Raises KeyError if the set is empty.
remove(x)         Remove an element from the set. Raises KeyError if the element does not exist in the set.
symmetric_difference() Return a set that is the symmetric difference between two sets.  (set1 ^ set2)
symmetric_difference_update()  Update the set, adding elements that are in either set but not both.
union()          Return a set that contains all unique elements from two sets. (set1 | set2)
update()         Update the set, adding new elements that donâ€™t already exist in the set.
