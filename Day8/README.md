## List Methods
Today we will discuss about the list methods in python. In this section, I'll explain some important list methods and provide examples to demonstrate their usage. 
Operations in Python.
1. `append()`: Add an element to the end of a list.
2. `insert(i,x)`: Insert an element at a specific position 'i' in the list.
3. `remove(x)`: Remove the first occurrence of value 'x'.
4. `pop([i])`: Return and remove the item at the given position in the list. If no index is provided then it removes and returns the last item in the list. Raises an error if there is no such item.  Raises an error if there is no such item. Raises an error if not found.
5. `clear()`:  Removes all elements from the list.
6. `index(x[,start[,end]])`: Returns the index of the first (or only) occurrence of value ‘x’ in the list. The slice notation can also be used.
7. `copy`  : Returns a copy of object.
8. `sort()`, `sorted()`: Sorts the list in ascending order.
9. `reverse()`: Reverses the list.
10. `extend()`: Add multiple items to the end of the list.
11. `count()` : Count how many times an item appears in the list.


## Nesting Lists
List can contain other lists as its elements. This is called nesting or embedding lists. 
Nested lists are created by placing one or more sets of square brackets inside another set of square  brackets. 
Nested lists are used when you want to group related data together within a single list.
Nested lists are used when you have data that has more than one dimension.
Nested lists are used when you need to store related data together.
List can contain other lists as its elements. This is known as nesting or embedding lists.


## Tuple
Tuples are similar to lists but they can not be changed once created. They are used when you want to store data that should not be modified. The syntax for creating tuples is same as lists Methods, instead of square brackets, we use round brackets.
Tuples are similar to lists but they can not be changed once created. They are immutable i.e., we cannot add or remove elements from them.
Tuples are similar to lists but they can not be changed after creation unlike lists. They support operations like addition and multiplication.
